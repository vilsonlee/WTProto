# WTProto
WTProtocol re-encapsulates the XMPP communication protocol based on XMPPFramework.

### Install

The minimum deployment target is iOS 10.0

#### CocoaPods

The easiest way to install WTProto is using CocoaPods.

To install only the Objective-C portion of the framework:

```
pod 'WTProto'
```

```
After `pod install` open the `.xcworkspace` and import what you need from WTProto
```

#### Carthage

To integrate WTProto into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "vilson/WTProto"
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `WTProto.framework` into your Xcode project.
