 * How often to send a ping.
 *
 * The internal timer fires every (pingInterval / 4) seconds.
 * Upon firing it checks when data was last received from the target,
 * and sends a ping if the elapsed time has exceeded the pingInterval.
 * Thus the effective resolution of the timer is based on the configured interval.
 *
 * To temporarily disable auto-ping, set the interval to zero.
 *
 * The default pingInterval is 60 seconds.

 * How long to wait after sending a ping before timing out.
 *
 * The timeout is decoupled from the pingInterval to allow for longer pingIntervals,
 * which avoids flooding the network, and to allow more precise control overall.
 *
 * After a ping is sent, if a reply is not received by this timeout,
 * the delegate method is invoked.
 *
 * The default pingTimeout is 10 seconds.

 * If the targetJID is nil, this implies the target is the xmpp server we're connected to.
 * In this case, receiving any data means we've received data from the target.
 *
 * If the targetJID is non-nil, it must be a full JID (user@domain.tld/rsrc).
 * In this case, the module will monitor the stream for data from the given JID.
 *
 * The default targetJID is nil.

 * XMPPAutoPing is used to automatically send pings on a regular interval.
 * Sometimes the target is also sending pings to us as well.
 * If so, you may optionally set respondsToQueries to YES to allow the module to respond to incoming pings.

 * If you create multiple instances of XMPPAutoPing or XMPPPing,
 * then only one instance should respond to queries.
